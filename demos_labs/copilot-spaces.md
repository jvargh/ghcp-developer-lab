# GitHub Copilot Spaces Demo

Welcome to the GitHub Copilot Spaces demo! In this exercise, you'll learn how to create and utilize GitHub Copilot Spaces to collaborate on development tasks within the Photo Gallery & Portfolio application.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this demo, you will:

- Understand what GitHub Copilot Spaces are and their benefits
- Know how to create a new Copilot Space
- Be able to set up a Space with specific goals and context
- Complete development tasks using collaborative AI assistance
- Share and manage Spaces with team members

**Estimated Time:** 20-25 minutes

## 🚀 Step 1: Commit and Push Your Code to GitHub

Before using Copilot Spaces with your repository, your latest local changes need to be available on GitHub.

**Exercise:**

1.  Open the **Source Control** panel in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+G`).
2.  Review the list of changed files. Stage all changes by clicking the **+** icon next to **Changes**, or run:

```
git add .
```

1.  Enter a commit message (e.g., `Initial setup for Copilot Spaces lab`) and commit:

```
git commit -m "Initial setup for Copilot Spaces lab"
```

1.  Push your branch to GitHub:

```
git push origin HEAD
```

1.  Verify the push by opening your repository on GitHub and confirming your latest commit appears.

**💡 Pro Tip:** If you haven't set the upstream branch yet, use `git push -u origin <branch-name>` on the first push.

**Alternative: Use Agent Mode with GitHub MCP**

Instead of running manual git commands, you can ask Copilot in **Agent** mode to handle the commit and push for you. Make sure the GitHub MCP server is configured in `.vscode/mcp.json`, then run:

```
Commit all current changes with the message "Initial setup for Copilot Spaces lab" and push to the remote repository.
```

Copilot will stage, commit, and push your changes using the available terminal and MCP tools.

1.  Select `Add sources` and select `Add text content`
2.  Add the following content. Use title `OWASP Top 10 2021 - Key Security Risks for Web Applications` and press `save`

```
1. **A01 Broken Access Control** - Users can act outside of their intended permissions
2. **A02 Cryptographic Failures** - Failures related to cryptography which often leads to sensitive data exposure
3. **A03 Injection** - User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application
4. **A04 Insecure Design** - Risks related to design and architectural flaws
5. **A05 Security Misconfiguration** - Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack
6. **A06 Vulnerable and Outdated Components** - Using components with known vulnerabilities
7. **A07 Identification and Authentication Failures** - Confirmation of the user's identity, authentication, and session management
8. **A08 Software and Data Integrity Failures** - Code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations
9. **A09 Security Logging and Monitoring Failures** - Failures in logging and monitoring coupled with missing or ineffective integration with incident response
10. **A10 Server-Side Request Forgery** - SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL

## Next.js Security Headers

- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy

## File Upload Security Considerations

- File type validation
- File size limits
- Malware scanning
- Secure file storage
- Image processing vulnerabilities
```

**Outcome:** You now have a fully configured Copilot Space with security-focused instructions, relevant project source files, and OWASP reference material loaded as context. This Space is ready to use in Step 3, where you'll ask it to perform a security analysis of the photo gallery application.

## 🤝 Step 3: Collaborate and Share

**Goal:** Use the Copilot Space you created in Step 2 to complete the task listed below.

**Challenge:** If your group created the Space in an organization, switch Copilot Spaces to try out the other group's Space! I.e, if you chose **Group B** in Step 2, try the **Group A** Space this time and vice versa.

### Group A Option

1.  Go to `https://github.com/copilot/spaces` and open the **Photo Gallery - Security Assessment** Space
2.  Type in the following prompt to analyze security vulnerabilities:

```
I need help identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities in our photo gallery application. Please analyze our file upload component and suggest:

1. How to validate file types securely (not just by extension)
2. Protection against malicious file uploads and XSS attacks
3. Proper input sanitization for photo titles and tags
4. Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for Next.js
5. Rate limiting strategies for upload endpoints

Based on the OWASP Top 10 guidelines, what are the most critical security issues I should address first in this photo gallery application?
```

1.  Ask another question! What else do you want to learn?

### Group B Option

### Final discussion

**How were you able to collaborate with your team using Copilot Spaces?**

- Shared a single Space with the team so everyone had the same context, instructions, and source files — no need to repeat setup or re-explain the codebase.
- Could hand off the Space link and a teammate could immediately continue the conversation with full context.
- The Space acted as a shared knowledge base, keeping security findings or documentation decisions in one place.

**How did Copilot's suggestions help (or hinder) your collaboration?**

- ✅ Copilot gave consistent, context-aware answers because the instructions and source files were pre-loaded — everyone got responses aligned with the same security/documentation standards.
- ✅ It accelerated repetitive tasks like generating boilerplate docs, listing OWASP risks, or drafting CSP headers.
- ❌ Copilot may have generated overly generic recommendations when the source files didn't provide enough detail about the actual implementation (e.g., no real API routes exist yet).

**What would you do differently next time to improve teamwork and productivity?**

- Add more source files upfront (e.g., all component files, config files) so Copilot has a fuller picture of the codebase.
- Write more specific instructions to narrow Copilot's focus to the exact task at hand instead of broad topics.
- Split large tasks into separate Spaces (e.g., one for upload security, one for auth) rather than covering everything in a single Space.

Share your thoughts and any tips you discovered for making the most of Copilot Spaces in a team setting.

- **✅** You will have successfully used AI assistance with industry-standard external sources to either conduct a security analysis or create comprehensive documentation for the Photo Gallery & Portfolio application.
